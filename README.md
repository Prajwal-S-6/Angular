# Angular Practice and Testing Repository

This repository contains my practice code for **Angular development**, along with a focus on **testing strategies** using both **unit tests**, **component tests**, **end-to-end (E2E) tests with Cypress**.
The purpose of this repo is to explore Angular features hands-on while building strong habits around testing and code quality.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

* Practice **Angular concepts** (components, services, RxJS, routing)
* Learn and apply **Angular unit testing best practices**
* Explore **Cypress Component & E2E testing** for UI validation and API interaction
* Build confidence in writing maintainable, testable Angular code

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

* Expand Cypress tests for more complex scenarios
* Add CI pipeline integration for automated tests
* Try out **Jest** as an alternative test runner
* Add performance testing for critical Angular components
